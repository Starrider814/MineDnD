# MineDnD
A DM's Mod for Minecraft
by Matt Foutch

Idea: Players get together in a Minecraft server, where they don armor and a DM leads them through Dungeons and Dragons Encounters.

The DM can change the game from live action to a turn based combat mode, where the players will fight just like the tabletop game.
